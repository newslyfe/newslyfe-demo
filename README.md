## üéØ Problem & Solution

The global news stream is chaotic and unmanageable with traditional tools. NewsLyfe organizes this information flood into a focused, high-performance workspace, giving users back control. Nearly 100,000 new articles arrive daily from almost 7,000 sources‚Äîall in a single, manageable interface.

**The platform is algorithmically neutral.** We do not rank, highlight, or remove news. Display is strictly chronological; content and freshness are the responsibility of the source domains. Our goal is to provide a clean, manipulation-free tool for users.

This is a web application that brings native software functionality to the browser. Responsiveness, customization, persistence, and modularity go far beyond what a typical website offers.
